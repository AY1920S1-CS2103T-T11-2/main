/*
Step 6
Construtor for new Game()

/*
Step 15
Game needs to interface for:

gameplay stuff:
start(), pause(), exit()
guess(String), pass()
*/

/*
Step 16
Internally has to display on Ui. Hard to comment the flow here.
Follow the code in this order of:

Find command in FindCommand.java
updateFilteredPersonList(Predicate<Person> predicate) in ModelManager.java
Somehow they used this javafx.collections.transformation.FilteredList;
and displayed it using stuff in ui package

(╯°□°)╯︵ ┻━┻

Thats the overall flow. Get ready for Tuesdays hackathon.
