== Overview

AddressBook - Level 3 is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *Word Bank features*.
** What it does: manages the app's overall data structure, and commands that manipulates it.
** Justification: A memory flash-card app requires a flexible data storage system.
** Highlights: As this feature lays the basis for the app, it requires a thorough understanding of Logic, Model, Storage, diving into the details in order to refactor and implement code.
** Credits: Jason for initial refactoring of address book.

* *Minor enhancement*: drag and drop feature for the word bank
