== image:address_book_32.png[icon, 39, 36] Overview of _Dukemon_
//== Overview of _Dukemon_

._Dukemon_'s design.
image::DukemonWithMewOnly.png[width="400"]

_Dukemon_ is a desktop flashcard application, whose aim is to streamline and gamify
the process of learning words and definitions. +
The user interacts with it primarily through a CLI (Command Line Interface), with some GUI (Graphical User Interface) features.

Allow me to brief you on some useful terms and to give you a context.

1. Flashcards are termed as `Cards`. +
2. A collective set of `Cards` are termed as `WordBank`.

3. A general flow of _Dukemon_'s usage is as follows:

.. Note taking phase

... User creates/selects a `WordBank`.
... User populates the `WordBank` with `Cards`, or edit the `Cards`.

.. Learning phase

... User starts the game using selected `WordBank`.
... _Dukemon_ prompts the questions, and user has to answer accordingly.
... _Dukemon_ ends the game.
... User reviews performance from statistics page.

== Summary of contributions

=== Major feature
*Word Bank Management*

* *What it does:* +
** Enables user to have a high level management for his word banks and cards through CLI and GUI. +
Is semi-automated by _Dukemon_ to enhance user's learning experience. +
Consists of four complementary distinct sections.

. *Word bank's data structure and its storage system*: +
Allows developers to use and extend this architecture to streamline their feature implementation. +
Allows user to save and load their word banks. +
Is implemented with a robust underlying `WordBankList` data structure, with its
own `WordBankListStorage`,
along with rich integration of `Model`, `Storage`, `Logic` and `UI` to synchronise its
data.

. *User Commands*: +
Allows user to customise cards/word banks through `CardCommands` / `WordBankCommands`.

. *Drag and drop*: +
Allows user to export their word bank out of their computer simply by dragging it out of _Dukemon_. +
Likewise, it allows user to import a word bank file from their computer by dragging it into _Dukemon_.

. *Revision word bank*: +
Allows user to visit a centralised word bank that automatically collects cards for revision. +
Cards that were answered wrongly are automatically added to this revision bank. +
Likewise, cards that were answered correctly during game play are automatically removed from this revision bank.

//{nbsp}

* *Justification:*

** Well designed architecture and well implemented data structure streamlines integration and allows extension for
features that builds on top of it. (statistics, game, settings)

** Management system is essential for a self-typed flashcard app like _Dukemon_.

** Drag and drop accelerates the sharing of knowledge/notes with friends, thereby enhancing user experience. +

** Revision bank improves the learning process by helping the user collate cards that requires revision.

//{nbsp}

* *Highlights:*

** There exists multiple ways to design and implement word bank management. Throughout _Dukemon_'s development,
it has been restructured and rewritten a few times before finally coming to how it is implemented now. +
This was primarily because my teammate's features requires heavy and continuous integration with word banks management. We came together twice every week to discuss how our features should be integrated with one another. +
To best implement it, I spent considerable amount of effort to study different design patterns and architectural styles, such as _MVC (Model View Controller)_,
_Observer Pattern_, _n-Tier Style_, _Event-Driven Style_, to realise the final design.

** Continual in-depth discussion with team member, Subbash, to find the best design to integrate user commands
with his different modes.

** Discussed with team member, Paul, who is in-charge of UI, on _Observer Pattern_ usage to display word banks and cards that automatically
update itself.

** Consulted team member, Jason, on how I can best leverage his statistics feature to streamline my revision word bank implementation.

** Learned and adapted _Callbacks_ and _Functional Programming_ into my drag and drop section
to preserve the quality and structural integrity of the existing code base, from team member Yi Da.

** Individually Sourced for proper online tutorials and online code references to implement drag and drop section,
and design concepts such as _Observer Pattern_ and _MVC_ within cards and word banks.

** Teammates
*** For their continual discussion, presence and support as mentioned in my highlights above.
** Tutors
*** For their unconditional effort in guiding us and providing us with valuable resources and feedback throughout Dukemon's development.

=== Minor features
** Default word banks for new players
*** Implemented multiple user friendly word banks for user to try out. (pokemon, arithmetic, trivia, graph, cs2103t)
*** Created on the first launch of _Dukemon_ (implemented through preferences file), and behaves like normal word bank. (Can be edited and removed)

** User experience centric messages
*** Played the game insane amount of times to design constructive feedback to display on the command box from the user perspective.
*** Developed user friendly command usage feedback that guides the user to using _Dukemon_.

** Automatic creation of folders.
*** Implemented the initialisation of required folders for related files automatically if not present.
