== image:address_book_32.png[icon, 39, 36] Overview of _Dukemon_
//== Overview of _Dukemon_

._Dukemon_'s design.
image::DukemonWithMewOnly.png[width="400"]

_Dukemon_ is a desktop flashcard application, whose aim is to streamline and gamify
the process of learning words and definitions. +
The user interacts with it primarily through a CLI (Command Line Interface), with some GUI (Graphical User Interface) features.

Allow me to brief you on some useful terms and to give you a context.

1. Flashcards are termed as `Cards`. +
2. A collective set of `Cards` are termed as `WordBank`.

3. A general flow of _Dukemon_'s usage is as follows:

.. Note taking phase

... User creates/selects a `WordBank`.
... User populates the `WordBank` with `Cards`, or edit the `Cards`.

.. Learning phase

... User starts the game using selected `WordBank`.
... _Dukemon_ prompts the questions, and user has to answer accordingly.
... _Dukemon_ ends the game.
... User reviews performance from statistics page.

== Summary of contributions

=== Major feature
*Word Bank Management*.

* What it does: +
** Enables user to have a high level management for his word banks and cards through CLI and GUI. +
Is also semi-automated by _Dukemon_ to enhance user's learning experience. +
Consist of four complementary distinct sections.

. *Word bank's data structure and it's storage system*: +
Allows developers to use and extend this architecture to streamline their feature implementation. +
Is implemented with a robust underlying `WordBankList` data structure, with it's own `WordBankListStorage`,
along with rich integration of `Model`, `Storage`, `Logic` and `UI` to synchronise it's data.

. *User Commands*: +
Allows users to edit cards/word banks through `CardCommands` / `WordBankCommands`.

. *Drag and drop*: +
Allows user to export their word bank to their computer simply by dragging it out of _Dukemon_. +
Likewise, it allows user to drag a word bank file into _Dukemon_ to import the word bank.

. *Revision word bank*: +
Serves as a centralised bank that collects cards across different word banks throughout the game play,
to enhance learning experience. +
Cards that were answered wrongly are automatically added to this revision bank. +
Likewise, cards that were answered correctly during game play are automatically removed from this revision bank.

//{nbsp}

* Justification:

** Management system is essential for a self-typed flashcard app like _Dukemon_.

** Well designed architecture and well implemented data structure streamlines integration with other features
that builds on top of it. (statistics, game, settings)

** Accelerates sharing of word banks with friends, thereby enhancing learning experience through sharing of knowledge/notes with friends.

** Revision bank improves learning experience for the user, by helping the user automatically aggregate cards that were answered wrongly.

//{nbsp}

* Highlights:

** As this feature lays the basis for the app, it needs to be implemented well to support integration with every component of the app.

**

**

//{nbsp}

* Credits: +

** Subbash and Paul for holding a heavy discussion on how to integrate and name different modes altogether. +
** Subbash for his `Home` mode to host my `WordBankComands` and `Open` mode to host my `CardCommands`.
** Jason for huge initial refactoring of address book. Leveraged on parts of his statistics to implement some parts of revision bank. +
** Yi Da for his suggestion on using call backs from within a deeply nested function to access the CommandBox. +
** Paul for integration of my `WordBank` and `Card` display on the UI.

=== Minor features
** Default word banks for new players.
*** Three user friendly word banks for user to try out. (pokemon, arithmetic and trivia)
*** They are created on the first launch of _Dukemon_, and behaves like normal word bank. (Can be removed)

** Greatly improve user experience
*** Played the game insane amount of times to design constructive feedback to display on the command box from the user perspective.
*** Developed user friendly command usage feedback that guides the user to using _Dukemon_.


** Automatically creation of folder for _Dukemon_ related files if not present.

** Preference.json file

=== Other contributions
* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_

* *Other contributions* :
** Discovered and fixed multiple bugs across different parts of _Dukemon_.


** Project management:
*** Selected members and formed the team. Went extra miles to bond the team through fine details.
*** Heavily scrutinised ideas during early stage of idea development, to ensure belief in our product.
*** Set up organisation repo, including issues, label and milestones.
*** Set up Netlify.
*** Took the initiative to kick start the project when team members were taking it easy.

//** Enhancements to existing features:
//*** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests https://github.com[#36], https://github.com[#38])

** Documentation:
*** Wrote the skeleton of User Guide: https://https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-2/main/blame/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc.com[#14]

** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): https://github.com[#12], https://github.com[#32], https://github.com[#19], https://github.com[#42]
//*** Contributed to forum discussions (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3], https://github.com[4])
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
//*** Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates (https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2])

** Tools: +
JUnit testing +
Netlify
//*** Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project (https://github.com[#42])
//*** Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo
