== image:address_book_32.png[icon, 39, 36] Overview of _Dukemon_

.The Home Page of Dukemon upon initial start-up.
image::DukemonWithMew.png[width="790"]

_Dukemon_ aims to streamline and gamify the process of learning words or definitions through
the use of self-created digital flashcards.

These flashcards are termed as `Cards`. +
Every `Card` is contained in a `WordBank`.

General flow of program usage:

* Note taking phase

. User creates/selects a `WordBank`
. User populates/edits the `WordBank` with `Cards`

* Learning phase

. User starts the game using selected `WordBank`
. Dukemon prompts questions, and user has to answer
. Dukemon ends the game
. User reviews performance from statistics page

== Summary of contributions

=== Major feature
*Word Bank Management*.

* Feature: +
** Enables user to have full control over his word banks and cards through typed commands and
graphical user interface. Behind the scenes, Dukemon manages your word banks automatically.

. *Word Bank's data structure and storage*: +
Is implemented with a robust underlying `WordBankList` data structure, with it's own `WordBankListStorage`,
along with rich integration of `Model`, `Storage`, `Logic` and `UI` to synchronise it's data.

. *User Commands*: +
Allows users to edit cards/word banks through `CardCommands`/ `WordBankCommands`.

. *Drag and Drop*: +
Supports sharing of word banks with friends. +
User can export their word bank to their computer simply by dragging it out of Dukemon. +
Likewise, drag a word bank file into Dukemon to import the word bank.

. *Revision Word Bank*: +
Serves as a centralised bank that collects cards across different word banks throughout the game play. +
Cards that were answered wrongly are automatically added to this revision bank. +
Likewise, cards that were answered correctly during game play are automatically removed from this revision bank.

//{nbsp}

* Justification:

** Allowing user to edit his own card and grouping these cards according to topics (Word Banks) is
essential for a self-typed flashcard app like Dukemon.

** Well designed architecture and well implemented data structure streamlines integration with other features
that builds on top of it. (statistics, settings, game modes)

** Revision bank improves learning experience for the user, by helping the user automatically aggregate cards that were answered wrongly.

** Learning can be enhanced through sharing of knowledge/notes with friends. Drag and Drop feature accelerates this process.

//{nbsp}

* Highlights:

** As this feature lays the basis for the app, it needs to be implemented well to support integration with every component of the app.

**

**

//{nbsp}

* Credits: +

** Subbash and Paul for holding a heavy discussion on how to integrate and name different modes altogether. +
** Subbash for his `Home` mode to host my `WordBankComands` and `Open` mode to host my `CardCommands`.
** Jason for huge initial refactoring of address book. Leveraged on parts of his statistics to implement some parts of revision bank. +
** Yi Da for his suggestion on using call backs from within a deeply nested function to access the CommandBox. +
** Paul for integration of my `WordBank` and `Card` display on the UI.

=== Minor features
** Default word banks for new players.
*** Three user friendly word banks for user to try out. (pokemon, arithmetic and trivia)
*** They are created on the first launch of Dukemon, and behaves like normal word bank. (Can be removed)

** Greatly improve user experience
*** Played the game insane amount of times to design constructive feedback to display on the command box from the user perspective.
*** Developed user friendly command usage feedback that guides the user to using Dukemon.

** Automatically creation of folder for Dukemon related files if not present.

** Preference.json file

=== Other contributions
* *Code contributed*: [https://github.com[Functional code]] [https://github.com[Test code]] _{give links to collated code files}_

* *Other contributions* :
** Discovered and fixed multiple bugs across different parts of Dukemon.

** Project management:
*** Selected members and formed the team. Went extra miles to bond the team through fine details.
*** Heavily scrutinised ideas during early stage of idea development, to ensure belief in our product.
*** Set up organisation repo, including issues, label and milestones.
*** Set up Netlify.
*** Took the initiative to kick start the project when team members were taking it easy.

//** Enhancements to existing features:
//*** Wrote additional tests for existing features to increase coverage from 88% to 92% (Pull requests https://github.com[#36], https://github.com[#38])

** Documentation:
*** Wrote the skeleton of User Guide: https://https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-2/main/blame/master/docs/UserGuide.adoc.com[#14]

** Community:
*** PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): https://github.com[#12], https://github.com[#32], https://github.com[#19], https://github.com[#42]
//*** Contributed to forum discussions (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3], https://github.com[4])
*** Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples:  https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2], https://github.com[3])
//*** Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates (https://github.com[1], https://github.com[2])

** Tools: +
JUnit testing +
Netlify
//*** Integrated a third party library (Natty) to the project (https://github.com[#42])
//*** Integrated a new Github plugin (CircleCI) to the team repo
