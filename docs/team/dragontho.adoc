== PROJECT: AddressBook - Level 3


== Overview

Dukemon is a desktop flashcard application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *a settings page to the application*.
** What it does: allows the user to change specific settings about the application. Difficulty level, colour theme, hints and avatar are the features that are implemented in settings so far.
*** *Difficulty*: Allows the user to change the difficulty of the game in the application to one of three settings: Easy, Medium and Hard.
*** *Theme*: Allows the user to change to one of two themes: Dark and Light.
*** *Hints*: Allows the user to either enable hints to help them in the game or to disable them.
*** *Avatar*: Allows the user to set the avatar in the home screen based on the provided avatars' id number.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it provides options for the user to personalise their experience when using our application.
** Highlights: This enhancement creates a platform for other developers to add their own user settings into the application, allowing for increased extendability. The process had to encroach on storage, logic as well as model and was rather challenging to integrate.
** Credits: Yi Da for implementing difficulty and hints and for integrating his logic to my settings. Jason for providing the avatars to use for my settings.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added a modular display to change screens depending on what mode the application is in.
