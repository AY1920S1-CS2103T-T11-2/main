== PROJECT: Dukemon


== Overview

*Dukemon* is a desktop flashcard application used for memorising material in a fun and engaging way.
The user operates the application through a CLI and runs on Java and the JavaFX framework.
My main contribution to the team was the implementation of settings and the settings screen.

I realise that our application was going to be UI heavy as the way we planned our application involved a lot of screens.
I took it upon myself to learn how the JavaFX framework worked and made a platform for the rest of my
fellow developers to build their UI components on.

== Summary of contributions

** *Major enhancement*: added *a settings page to the application*.

.Settings Page

** [underline]_What it does_:
*** Allows the user to change specific settings about the application. Difficulty level, colour theme, hints and avatar are the features that are implemented in settings so far.
**** *Difficulty*: Allows the user to change the difficulty of the game in the application to one of three settings: Easy, Medium and Hard.
**** *Theme*: Allows the user to change to one of two themes: Dark and Light.
**** *Hints*: Allows the user to either enable hints to help them in the game or to disable them.
**** *Avatar*: Allows the user to set the avatar in the home screen based on the provided avatars' id number.
** [underline]_Justification_:
*** This feature improves the product significantly because it provides options for the user to personalise their experience when using our application.
*** For example, weaker students may use the settings to set the difficulty to easy or medium.
*** Furthermore, some students might not want hints so as to practise what they have learnt. They can do that in the settings as well.
** [underline]_Highlights_:
*** This enhancement creates a platform for other developers to add their own user settings into the application, allowing for increased extendability.
*** The process had to encroach on storage, logic as well as model and I learnt a lot integrating all the parts together.
** [underline]_Credits_:
*** Yi Da for implementing difficulty and hints and for integrating his logic to my settings. Jason for providing the avatars to use for my settings.
*** https://openjfx.io/[JavaFX 11] for GUI.
*** https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] and https://github.com/junit-team/junit5[JUnit5] for testing.

** *Minor enhancement*:

*** Added a modular display to change screens depending on what mode the application is in.
*** This was a necessary enhancement due to how UI-heavy our application is. We needed multiple screens to handle multiple tasks and this was the solution I proposed and implemented.

** *Code contributed*: [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-2/main/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/appsettings[Functional code]] [https://github.com/AY1920S1-CS2103T-T11-2/main/blob/master/src/test/java/seedu/address/model/AppSettingsTest.java[Test code]]

** *Other contributions*:
