*_Dukemon_* is a desktop app intended as a fun study tool. It is a CLI-centric
(_Command Line Interface_) app that expands upon the idea of Flashcards to aid
learning in a fun and exciting way. The main program flow of *_Dukemon_* is as
 follows:

1. User creates a _WordBank_.
2. User creates _Cards_ that have a _Word_ and _Meaning_ each.
3. User populates his _WordBank_ with such _Cards_.
4. User starts the _Game_ and tries to match _Meanings_ with _Words_ within a certain Time.
5. User completes the _Game_ and reviews his performance _Statistics_.

Developed by my team and I, *_Dukemon_* transforms the basic concept of _Flashcards_
into an exciting and engaging game-like app through features such as _automatic Hints_, _Statistics_
and so much more. +
 +
Below are some *highlights* of the important contributions that I have made to the
development of *_Dukemon_*.

* *Added a Timer and automatic Hint feature*

** [underline]#_Brief Description_#:
*** A _live_ text and graphical countdown _Timer_ (region in yellow box above) that shows the User how much time is left.
*** Based on the time left, _Hints_ (presented in a Hangman style)
are also automatically generated and shown to the user (region in blue box above).

** [underline]#_Justification_#:
*** This enhancement greatly improves the product as it achieves the intended goal of creating a *game-like environment* for learning.
The User is also thus able to access his own performance and capability in a fun and engaging way.
*** The Hints also aids in learning, especially for weaker students or when trying out unfamiliar words.
*** Introducing Hints incrementally is also a conscious design as it is gives the User time to think,
as opposed to one-shot hints that risk making the game too easy with hints.

** [underline]#_Highlights_#:
*** Implementing this enhancement was challenging as it required *seamless integration* between
the GUI (Graphical User Interface) and internal logical components in *real time*.
*** Utilized *advanced programming design concepts* such as _Observer Patterns_, _Callbacks_ and _Functional Programming_ to preserve the
quality and structural integrity of the existing code base.
*** Researched about the _JavaFX_ framework to ensure proper synchronization, especially for testing and verification.
*** Integrated external _TestFX_ library to allow for testing of Timer and other components that run on the _JavaFX Application Thread_
*** Utilized advanced Java concepts and API like `java.util.concurrent.CountdownLatch` and `java.lang.reflect` to run tests for _Callbacks_ and
the _Timer_ effectively.

** [underline]#_Credits_# _(Framework/Libraries used)_:
*** https://openjfx.io/[JavaFX 11] (GUI)
*** https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] (Testing)
*** https://github.com/junit-team/junit5[JUnit5] (Testing)

** [underline]#_Credits_# _(People)_:
*** Jason (@jascxx) for the bug resolution and implementation of `Cards`.
*** Paul (@dragontho) for integration of Hints and Questions with UI.

=== Other Enhancements - Game image:game_mode_icon.png[width=50]

* *Implemented and designed the _Game_ logic, UI and Difficulty.*

** [underline]#_Brief Description_#:
*** The primary feature of _Dukemon_ is the _Game_ where the User makes guesses for _Words_ based on a _Meaning_ shown.
*** Different _Difficulty_ modes are available that changes the time allowed per question, and also the number of _Hints_ displayed.
are also automatically generated and shown to the user (region in blue box above).
