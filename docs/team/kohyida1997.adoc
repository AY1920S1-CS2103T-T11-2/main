*_Dukemon_* is a desktop app intended to be a study tool. It is a CLI-centric
(_Command Line Interface_) app that expands upon the idea of Flashcards to aid
learning in a fun and exciting way. The main program flow of *_Dukemon_* is as
 follows:

1. User creates a _WordBank_.
2. User creates _Cards_ that have a _Word_ and _Meaning_ each.
3. User populates his _WordBank_ with such _Cards_.
4. User starts the _Game_ and tries to match _Meanings_ with _Words_.
5. User completes the _Game_ and reviews his performance _Statistics_.

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to undo/redo previous commands*
** What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
** Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
** Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
** Credits: _{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}_

* *Minor enhancement*: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
