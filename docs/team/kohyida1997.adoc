*_Dukemon_* is a desktop app intended as a fun study tool. It is a CLI-centric
(_Command Line Interface_) app that expands upon the idea of Flashcards to aid
learning in a fun and exciting way. The main program flow of *_Dukemon_* is as
 follows:

1. User creates a _WordBank_.
2. User creates _Cards_ that have a _Word_ and _Meaning_ each.
3. User populates his _WordBank_ with such _Cards_.
4. User starts the _Game_ and tries to match _Meanings_ with _Words_ within a certain Time.
5. User completes the _Game_ and reviews his performance _Statistics_.

Developed by my team and I, *_Dukemon_* transforms the basic concept of _Flashcards_
into an exciting and engaging game-like app through features such as _automatic Hints_, _Statistics_
and so much more. +
 +
Below are some *highlights* of the important contributions that I have made to the
development of *_Dukemon_*.

=== image:game_timer_icon.png[width="13"] Main Enhancements - Timer and Hints

.UI of Dukemon in Game Mode, showing the dynamic Timer and Hint features I implemented.
image::UserGuideGameSessionDiagram1.png[width="430"]

* *Added a Timer and automatic Hint feature*

** [underline]#_Brief Description_#:
*** A _live_ text and graphical countdown _Timer_ (region in yellow box above) that shows the User how much time is left. Based on the time left, _Hints_ (presented in a Hangman style)
are also automatically generated and shown to the user (region in blue box above).

** [underline]#_Justification_#:
*** This enhancement greatly improves the product as it achieves the intended goal of creating a *game-like learning environment* for the User that is fun and engaging.
*** Hints aids in learning, especially for weaker students or when trying out unfamiliar words.
*** Incremental as opposed to one-shot hints gives the User time to think, and doesn't potentially render the _Game_ too easy with hints.

** [underline]#_Highlights_#:
*** Challenging as it required *seamless integration* and *synchronization* between
the GUI (Graphical User Interface) and internal logical components in *real time*.
*** Utilized *advanced programming concepts* such as _Observer Patterns_, _Callbacks_ and _Functional Programming_ to preserve quality
and structural integrity of existing code base. API like `java.util.concurrent.CountdownLatch` and `java.lang.reflect` were used to run tests for _Callbacks_ and
the _Timer_ effectively.
*** Integrated external _TestFX_ library to allow for testing of _Timer_ and other components that run on the _JavaFX Application Thread_.

** [underline]#_Credits_# _(Framework/Libraries used)_:
*** https://openjfx.io/[JavaFX 11] (GUI), https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX[TestFX] (Testing), https://github.com/junit-team/junit5[JUnit5] (Testing)

** [underline]#_Credits_# _(People)_:
*** Jason (@jascxx) for the bug resolution and implementation of `Cards`.
*** Paul (@dragontho) for integration of Hints and Questions with UI.

=== image:game_mode_icon.png[width=32] Other Enhancement - Game

* *Implemented and designed the _Game_ logic, UI and Difficulty.*

** [underline]#_Brief Description_#:
*** The game is a primary feature _Game_ where the User makes guesses for _Words_ based on a _Meaning_ shown. Different _Difficulty_ modes are available that changes the time allowed per question.

== image:user-manual-icon.png[width=40] Contributions - User Guide

|===
|_Given below are the highlights of what I contributed to the User Guide, showcasing my ability to write documentation targeting end-users._
|===

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=yida-intro]

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=yida-quickstart]

=== Game Commands image:game_mode_icon.png[width="30"]
(Available in Game mode)

.UI regions that are relevant when a Game session is in progress.
image::UserGuideGameSessionDiagram1.png[width="450"]


This section covers the actions and feedback that are relevant to the _Game_ mode.  The general layout of the UI when a _Game_ is in progress is as seen above.

1. The timer will be activated to reflect the time left before the _Game_ skips over to the next card. (region in yellow box)

2. The _Meaning_ of the current _Card_ is shown in the region contained by the red box. Based on this _Meaning_ you will  make a _Guess_ for the _Word_ it is describing.

3. _Hints_ (if enabled) will be periodically shown as time passes (region in the blue box) in a Hangman-style. The number of hints given
differs across each _Difficulty_.

==== Game Mode - [underline]#Starting# image:game_mode_icon.png[width="30"]

The relevant command(s) are:

1. *Starting new game session:*
+
Format: `start [EASY/MEDIUM/HARD]`

- Starts a game session with the currently selected _WordBank_ and specified _Difficulty_.
(_WorkBank_ selection is done in _Home_ mode.)

- If no _Difficuty_ is specfied, the default _Difficulty_ in _Settings_
will be used.




==== Game Mode - [underline]#Playing# image:game_mode_icon.png[width="30"]

.UI regions that show feedback during a Game session.
image::UserGuideGameSessionDiagram2.png[width="550"]


During a _Game_, the _Timer_ will change colour according to the time left (region in green box). Feedback for each _Guess_ is shown via the _ResultDisplay_ (region in the red box). +
 +
The relevant command(s) are:

1. *Making a _Guess_ for a _Word_*: +
+
Format: `guess WORD`

- Makes a guess for the _Word_ described by the currently shown _Meaning_. (*non case-sensitive*)

2. *Skipping over a _Word_:*
+
Format: `skip`

- Skips over the current _Word_. (*is counted as a wrong answer*)


==== Game Mode - [underline]#Terminating & Statistics# image:game_mode_icon.png[width="30"]

.Comparison of UI Regions between Game finished vs. Game forcibly stopped.
image::GameFinishedGameStoppedComparison.png[width="1000"]


A _Game_ finishes when *all _Cards_ have been attempted*. _Statistics_ are
*automatically shown* upon completion of a _Game_ (see Fig. above). +
 +
The user can choose to `stop` a _Game_ before it has finished. This will result in all current _Game_ progress being lost, and
no _Statistics_ being collected or generated (see Fig. above). +
 +
The relevant command(s) are:

1. *Stopping a _Game_ (before it has finished)*: +
+
Format: `stop`

- Forcibly terminates the current active _Game_ session (*all progress will be lost, and no _Statistics_ will
be reported.*)
