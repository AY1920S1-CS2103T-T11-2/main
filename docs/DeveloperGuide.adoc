=== Architecture

.Dukemon Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of Dukemon. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java[`Main`] and link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java[`MainApp`]. It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of *Dukemon* contains _seven_ componenets.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: +
The Graphical UI of Dukemon that interacts with the user.
* <<Design-AppManager, *`AppManager`*>>: +
The buffer between the User and Dukemon's internal components.
* <<Design-Timer, *`Timer`*>>: +
The internal Timer that triggers events based on time elapsed.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: +
The main command executor and performer of operations.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: +
Holds the non-game data in-memory.
* <<Design-Game,*`Game`*>>: +
Holds the data of live game sessions in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: +
Reads data from, and writes data to, the local hard disk.

For the components UI, Logic, Model, Timer and Game:

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

// end::yida-design[]

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-AppManager]]
=== AppManager component

"Explain AppManager component"

[[Design-Timer]]
=== Timer component

[[fig-TimerClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Timer Component
image::TimerClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/appmanager/timer/GameTimer.java[`GameTimer.java`]

The `Timer` consists of a `GameTimer` that will keep track of time elapsed via an internal countdown timer
and notify the `AppManager`, who will notify the `UI` components.

* Dealing with the internal countdown timer that runs during a game session.
* Periodically triggering _callbacks_ that will notify the `AppManager` component.
* Gets timestamps to trigger `Hints` via a `HintTimingQueue`

_Due to the fact that the timer has to work closely with the `UI` and `AppManager` (without being
coupled directly), it is separated from the `Logic`, `Model` and `Game` components._

// tag::subbashdg2[]
[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component
_This section breakdown the logic package into its internal components_

Logic is primarily built by two segments: Command and Parser. 

It fulfils its contracts with other packages through two interfaces: Logic and UiLogicHelper

UiLogicHelper is a subset of Logic APIs and only contains transactions for AutoComplete and Command Execution.

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

* Interaction through `Logic Interface`

.  This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
.  The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a person).
.  The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui` and `AppManager`.
.  In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

* Interaction through `UiLogicHelper Interface`
.  The `ParserManager` class to parses the user command.
.  It updates the AutoComplete suggestions for every keystroke.
.  `ParserManager` instance has reference to a `SwitchModeParser` and `SpecificModeParser`
.   When a command is entered or user enters a keystroke, the `SwitchModeParser` and/or `SpecificModeParser` are accessed based on internal state.
.   Internal State consists of booleans: gameIsOver, bankLoaded and enumeration ModeEnum: HOME, OPEN, GAME, SETTINGS

Given below is the Activity Diagram that shows the workflows that change state of `ParserManager`.

NOTE: Home (No Switch) means HomeModeParser is used and SwitchModeParser is not used

// end::subbashdg2[]

// tag::chenhui-model[]

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Word Bank data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Card>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference. This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object. An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

// end::chenhui-model[]

// tag::yida-game[]

[[Design-Game]]
=== Game component


.Structure of the Game Component
image::GameClassDiagram.png[]

The `Game`,

* stores a _shuffled_ `List<Card>` that is cloned/copied from a `ReadOnlyWordBank`.
* maintains an `Index` to keep track of the state of the game.
* has an associated `DifficultyEnum` that dictates the time allowed for each question.
* verifies `Guess` that are sent by `Logic` (User's guesses)

// end::yida-game[]

// tag::chenhui-storage[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

// end::chenhui-storage[]
// tag::jasonstats[]
[[Design-Statistics]]
=== Statistics component
The Statistics component includes 2 main subcomponents:

* A `GlobalStatistics`, containing the user's total number of games played and the number of games played in the
current week.
* A `WordBankStatisticsList`, which is a collection of `WordBankStatistics`, one for each `WordBank`.


==== Implementation

The class diagram of the Statistics component is shown below:

.Statistics class diagram TO BE UPDATED.
image::StatisticsClassDiagram.png[]


The work of the Statistics component can be neatly captured and explained using a common series of user actions
when operating the app.

[%header,cols=3*]
|===
|User action
|Statistics work
|UI Statistics updates

|User opens the app.
|User's `GlobalStatistics` and `WordBankStatisticsList` are loaded into `Model` by the `MainApp`.
|User is shown their `GlobalStatistics` and their most played word bank from the `WordBankStatisticsList` in
the main title page.

|User selects a word bank.
|The selected `WordBankStatistics` from the `WordBankStatisticsList` is loaded into `Model`.
|

|User opens the selected word bank.
|
|In open mode, User is shown the `WordBankStatistics` of the opened word bank.

* A `GameStatistics` is created from the `GameStatisticsBuilder`.
* The `WordBankStatistics` and `GlobalStatistics` are updated accordingly and saved to disk.
| `GameStatistics` and the corresponding `WordBankStatistics` are displayed to user in the game result page.
|===


We will discuss each step with its implementation details primarily on the statistics work.

===== 1. [underline]#User opens the app# +

When the user opens the app, their `GlobalStatistics` and `WordBankStatisticsList` are loaded into `Model` by
`MainApp`.

.Sequence diagram for loading statistics
image::LoadStatisticsSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== 2. [underline]#User selects a word bank# +
When the user selects a word bank, the selected `WordBankStatistics` from the `WordBankStatisticsList` is loaded
into Model. +

.Sequence diagram for selecting a word bank statistics.
image::SelectWordBankStatisticsSequenceDiagram.png[]
It is necessary to set the active `WordBankStatistics` in the `Model` such that when the user opens the `WordBank`, the
`WordBankStatistics` can be found in `Model` and shown in the UI.

===== 3. [underline]#User opens the selected word bank# +
In open mode, the user is shown the `WordBankStatistics` of the opened word bank, which is set in `Model` at step 2.

===== 4. [underline]#User plays the game# +
A `GameStatisticsBuilder` is used to record user actions during the game.

When the user starts the game by calling a `StartCommand`, the `GameStatisticsBuilder` is initialized.

.Sequence diagram when user starts a game.
image::InitializeStatisticsSequenceDiagram.png[]

During the game, the `GameStatisticsBuilder` is updated with every `GuessCommand` or `SkipCommand` made. It receives
the timestamp from the `GameTimer` which also resides in `AppManager`.

.Sequence diagram when user makes a guess.
image::UpdateStatisticsSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== [underline]#5. User finishes the game# +
When the user finishes the game, a `GameStatistics` is created from the `GameStatisticsBuilder`. The `GameStatistics`
is shown to the user in the game result page.

The `GameStatistics` is used to update its corresponding `WordBankStatistics`, which is then saved to disk.
Additionally, the `GlobalStatistics` is also updated and saved to disk.

.Sequence diagram for saving the statistics to disk.
image::UpdateSaveStatisticsSequenceDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

There were some design considerations on implementing the statistics.

|===
||**Alternative 1**|**Alternative 2**
|**Aspect 1**: +
How to store `WordBankStatistics` in the storage?
| **Store in a separate file from the `WordBank` json file, but with the same name in a different directory.**

Example: `WordBank` data is stored at _data/wordbanks/pokemon.json_ while the `WordBankStatistics` data is stored at
_data/wbstats/pokemon.json_

_Pros:_ +
More abstraction to separate the data. +

_Cons:_ +
The data is linked by name, so if the user changes the file name, the link is broken. +

|**Store `WordBankStatistics` data in the same file as `WordBank`** +

_Pros:_ +
Less number of files. +

_Cons:_ +
Data is combined into one which lowers abstraction.

3+|**Why we decided to choose Alternative 1:** +
We decided that abstraction between the data is important as each team member should work in parallel, such that it is
easier for one person to modify the storage system for the word bank and another person to modify the storage system
for the word bank statistics freely.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.Dukemon.commons` package.


== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::autocompleteimplementation[]
=== [underline]#AutoComplete Feature# (for command execution)
==== Implementation

The AutoComplete is facilitated by `ParserManager`.
It dynamically changes parser depending on current mode the game is at. When updating the User Interface for every keystroke, it ensures only the right commands get parsed and autocompleted at each moment.

For the UI package to have access to this information, it exposes its functionality through `LogicManager` as `UiLogicHelper` interface with the following getter methods:

* `List<AutoFillAction>#getMenuItems(String text)` -- Gets an List of AutoFillActions to fill up AutoComplete display based on current user input given in text
* `ModeEnum#getMode()` -- Retrieves the application mode to display visually to the user (represented by enumeration object ModeEnum)
* `List<ModeEnum>#getModes()` -- Retrieves the possible modes the user can transition to from current mode

These operations are implemented in `SpecificModeParser` aided by `ClassUtil` to handle instantiation of Parser and Command objects.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the AutoCompletion mechanism behaves at each step.

Replace image with state of ParserManager



The following sequence diagram shows how the AutoComplete operation works:

image::AutoCompleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoDukemon()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.


The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.


==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How parser and command objects are instantiated in SpecificModeParser

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use java reflections to hold a List of Classes and iterate through them to pick the matching Classes
** Pros: Open Close Principle strictly followed. Adding a command with a parser takes only one line of code.
** Cons: It is developer responsibility to ensure classes subclass Command object as compile time errors would not be thrown.
* **Alternative 2:** Use switches in Parser to match Command Word to create Parser objects if necessary else directly create Command object.
** Pros: Compile time error would be thrown if new command or parser does not subclass correctly.
** Cons: Adding a new command with parser would require the developer to insert it into multiple locations as the autocomplete feature needs an iterable command list.

===== Aspect: Single Parser vs Parser Manager

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using a ParserManager to dynamically switch between Parsers based on current state
** Pros: Commands not belonging to specific mode would not be parsed
** Cons: More code to write for initial developer. However it is easily extnensible for new modes and parsers by the Open Close Principle
* **Alternative 2:** Use a single parser
** Pros: We do not need to restructure the logic package.
** Cons: Bad user experience as it autocompletes and parses commands that do not belong to a particular mode.
// end::autocompleteimplementation[]

// tag::settings[]
=== [underline]#Settings Feature#
==== Implementation
`AppSettings` was a class that was created to be integrated into the `Model` of the app. It currently contains these functionalities:

* `difficulty [EASY/MEDIUM/HARD]` to change the difficulty of the game.
* `hints [ON/OFF]` to turn hints on or off.
* `theme [DARK/LIGHT]` to change the theme of the app. Currently only supporting dark and light themes.

This feature provides the user an interface to make their own changes to the state of the machine. The settings set by the user will also be saved to a `.json` file under `data/appsettings.json`.

The activity diagram below summarizes what happens in the execution of a settings command:

.Activity diagram of the execution of a settings command.
image::SettingsActivityDiagram.png[]

[NOTE]
Take note that "mode" as defined in our project is the state in which the application is able to take commands specific to that mode.

Given below is a step by step walk-through of what happens when a user executes a difficulty command while in settings mode:

.Before state of application.
image::StateDiagramBefore.png[]
*Step 1:* +
Let us assume that the current difficulty of the application is "EASY". The object diagram above shows the current state of `AppSettings`.

.Sequence diagram of Step 2.
image::DifficultySequenceDiagram1.png[]
*Step 2:* +
When the user enters `difficulty hard`, the command gets passed into Ui first, which executes `AppManager#execute()`, which passes straight to `LogicManager#execute()` without any logic conditions to determine its execution path.

.Sequence diagram of Step 3.
image::DifficultySequenceDiagram2.png[]
*Step 3:* +
At `LogicManager#execute()` however, the command gets passed into a parser manager which filters out the `DifficultyCommand` as a non-switch command and it creates a `DifficultyCommand` to be executed.

.Sequence diagram of Step 4.
image::DifficultySequenceDiagram3.png[]
*Step 4:* +
Upon execution of the `DifficultyCommand`, the state of the model is changed such that the `DifficultyEnum` in `AppSettings` is now set to `HARD`.

.Sequence diagram of Step 5.
image::DifficultySequenceDiagram4.png[]
*Step 5:* +
Since the main function of the `difficulty` command is accomplished and all that is left is to update the ui, the `CommandResult` that is produced by the execution of the command goes back to `Ui` without much problem.

.Sequence diagram of Step 6.
image::DifficultySequenceDiagram5.png[]
*Step 6:* +
Assuming that there were no errors thrown during the execution of the `difficulty` command, the execution calls `updateModularDisplay` in `UpdateUi`. In here, the `ModeEnum.SETTINGS` is registered and it updates the settings display to properly reflect the change in difficulty.

The state of appSettings is then as follows:

.After state of application
image::StateDiagramAfter.png[]

==== Design Considerations

There were a few considerations for implementing an interface that essentially allows users to touch a lot of parts of the application through settings and some of these methods break software design principles. These are the considerations we came across:

|===
||**Alternative 1**|**Alternative 2**
|**Aspect 1**: +
Where to effect change when a setting is changed by the user
| **Effecting the change inside the `execute()` command of the settings commands**: +
 +
_Pros:_ +
Since the Command is taking care of all the execution, there is no need to worry about extra implementation of the settings' effects in their classes. +
 +
_Cons:_ +
However, there are certain situations that will break software design principles, such as the *Single Responsibility Principle* by doing the job of already existing classes.
|**Effecting the change in the part of the architecture that the setting is affecting. E.g, Changing the theme inside Ui or changing the difficulty inside model** +
 +
_Pros:_ +
This method practises good software engineering principles and it abides by the architecture diagram shown above as to where the changes of the settings are being effected. +
 +
_Cons:_ +
This method however requires that the reader gets familiar with the whole architecture diagram as they need to know where to implement the actual change in settings as opposed to creating a new class that performs the same functionality of an existing class.

3+|**Why did we choose Alternative 2:** +
We believe that software design principles exist for a reason. Furthermore, while alternative 1 may seem a lot simpler, Alternative 2 allows for extension just by adding new methods and refrains the user from having to extensively rework the structure of the application in order to add a new setting.

|**Aspect 2:** +
How to store information regarding the different settings
| **Storing it inside the enumerations that make up the choices for the settings** +
 +
_Pros:_ +
Having the information stored inside the enum allows for immutablilty, such that no other class can change the properties of the enums. Only the developer can change the values of the enums and it will subsequently affect all the methods and functionality that relies on said enum. +
 +
_Cons:_ +
In the case that the user wants to customise certain continuous settings such as time limit, they are unable to as those settings are already defined by the developer to be discrete options.
| **Storing it inside the classes that implement the settings** +
 +
_Pros_ +
The information is easily accessible from within the class itself and there is no need for extra import classes to handle the enums in alternative 1. +
 +
_Cons_ +
Unlike Alternative 1, the developer can create an extension to the class implementing the setting to allow the user to customise their settings even further, allowing for continuous values to be used rather than discrete values.
3+| **Why did we choose Alternative 1:** +
The considerations for this aspect was mainly down to how much customisability we wanted to grant our users. While having more customisability is better in some cases,
in this one, we do not think the added functionality of allowing the user to extensively customise their experience with our application to be particularly impactful not necessary. Moreover, alternative 2 makes for a less organised code base and we wanted to avoid that as much as possible.

// end::settings[]

// tag::yida-timer[]

=== [underline]#Timer Feature#

.Screenshot of the `Timer` component in action as seen through the `UI`.
image::TimerDGScreenshot.png[]

==== Implementation Overview

The `Timer` component utilizes the `java.util.Timer` API to simulate a stopwatch during a `Game`. It also relies on
using _Functional Interfaces_ as _callbacks_ to periodically notify other components in the system. Using _callbacks_
allows the `Timer` to enact changes in other components of the system without directly holding a reference to those
components.

Internally, the `Timer`
works by using the method `java.util.Timer.schedule()` that will schedule `java.util.TimerTasks` at a fixed rate.

An _Observer Pattern_ is loosly followed between the `Timer` and the other components. As opposed to defining an
_Observable_ interface, the `AppManager` simply passes in _method pointers_ into the `Timer` to _callback_ when an
event is triggered. The `AppManager` thus works closely with the `Timer` as the main hub to enact changes based on
signals given by the `Timer`.

[NOTE]
To avoid
synchronization issues with the `UI` component, all
`TimerTasks` (such as requesting to refresh a component of the `UI`) are forced to run on the *JavaFX Application Thread* using
`Platform.runLater()`.


.Class diagram reflecting how the callback-functions are organized in the Timer component.
image::TimerClassDiagramCallbacks.png[]

The three main events that are currently triggered by the `Timer` component which require a _callback_ are:

1. Time has elapsed, _callback_ to `AppManager` to update and display the new timestamp on the `UI`.
2. Time has run out (_reached zero_), _callback_ to `AppManager` to skip over to next `Card`.
3. Time has reached a point where `Hints` are to be given to the User, _callback_ to `AppManager` to retrieve a hint
and display accordingly on the `UI`.

The call-backs for each of these events are implemented as nested _Functional Interfaces_
within the  `GameTimer` interface, which is concretized via the `GameTimerManager`.

==== Flow of Events

This section describes the sequential flow of events in the life cycle of a `GameTimer` object.

.Sequence diagram describing the flow of registering and executing callbacks between the different components
image::TimerSequenceDiagram1.png[]

The `UI` component first registers callbacks with the `AppManager`, who then registers callbacks with
the `Timer` component. Periodically, the `Timer` will notify the `AppManager` to perform tasks to notify
the `UI` component. This is to provide better abstraction between the `UI` and `Timer`.

A `GameTimer` instance is created by the `AppManager` for every `Card` of a `Game`.
The `AppManager` provides information regarding the duration in which the `Timer` should run for, and whether
to trigger `Hints` at the point when a `GameTimer` instance is created.

==== Design Considerations

There were a few considerations for designing the `Timer` this way.

|===
||**Alternative 1**|**Alternative 2**
|**Aspect 1**: +
Where and How to effect changes to the `Ui` and other components when the `Timer` triggers an event.
| **Holding a reference to `Ui` and other components directly inside `GameTimer` itself**: +

_Pros:_ +
Straightforward and direct, can perform many different tasks on the dependent components.  +

_Cons:_ +
Poor abstraction and high potential for cyclic dependencies, resulting in high coupling.

|**Using _Functional Interfaces_ as Call-backs to notify components indirectly.** +

_Pros:_ +
Maintains abstraction and minimal coupling between `Timer` and other components  +

_Cons:_ +
Relies on developer to register correct call-back methods with the `Timer`. Different actions need to be
implemented as different call-backs separately. Possible overhead in performing few levels of call-backs.

3+|**Why did we choose Alternative 2:** +
To ensure better extendability of our code for future expansion, we felt it was important to maintain as much
abstraction between components. This is also to make life easier when there comes a need to
debug and resolve problems in the code.

=== [underline]#Word Bank features#
Dukemon, a flashcard app, requires a non-trivial implementation of a data structure to contain it's information. +
It comes along with a set of commands that either modifies it's data, or modify the view. +
These commands will then synchronise the data in storage, or update the model for viewing. +
Lastly, there is a cool drag and drop feature for word banks, to transfer the files into and out of your computer.

Let's begin by explaining some key terms:

A `Card` contains a word and a unique meaning. (May contain tags) +
`CardCommands` work on `Cards`. +

A `WordBank` contains multiple `Cards`. (May contain tags) +
`WordBankCommands` work on `WordBanks`.

A `WordBankList` contains multiple `WordBanks`.

Each time a `CardCommand` or `WordBankCommand` is executed, `Storage` data is synchronised and
`Model` gets updated automatically for `UI` to retrieve updated information for user viewing.

==== Data Structure Overview
We start from the lowest level - `Card`. +

.Class diagram of `Card`.
image::CardDiagram.png[]

A `Card` contains a unique `id`, a `word`, a unique `meaning`, a set of `tags`. +

`id` : for statistical tracking +
`word`: answer to the question +
`meaning`: the question that will appear in the game +
`tags`: optional tag to classify cards

[NOTE]
Cards with the same meaning are duplicates, and is disallowed.

{nbsp} +

---

Now the second level - `WordBank`

.Class diagram of `Word Bank`.
image::WordBankDiagram.png[]

A `WordBank` contains a `UniqueCardList` and a unique `name`. +

`UniqueCardList` : prevent duplicate cards +
`name`: unique name of the word bank +

[NOTE]
Internally, the `UniqueCardList` contains an observable list of `Card`.
This is so any changes to the cards gets updated in the `Model` and thus the `UI` automatically.

{nbsp} +

---

Now the third level - `WordBankList`

.Class diagram of `WordBankList`.
image::WordBankListDiagram.png[]

A `WordBankList` contains a `UniqueWordBankList`.

`UniqueWordBankList` : prevent duplicate word banks

[NOTE]
Internally, the `UniqueWordBankList` contains an observable list of `WordBank`.
This is so any changes to the word banks gets updated in the `Model` and thus the `UI` automatically.

In Dukemon, there is should only be one `WordBankList`, which is created upon `Storage` initialisation. +
`Model` holds a reference to that specific `WordBankList`.

==== Implementation of CardCommands and WordBankCommands
A card command edits the cards within a particular word bank. Therefore it needs to make function calls through the
WordBank data structure. +
A word bank command edits the word bank within that particular word bank list. Therefore it needs to make function calls through
the WordBankList data structure.

To have a better understanding of how these commands work, I will show you how these commands are structured in `Logic`
and then walk you through a Sequence Diagram of executing a particular command.

.Overview class diagram of `Logic` with emphasis on CardCommands and WordBankCommands.
image::WBLogicStorageModel.png[]

With the understanding of `WordBankList` data structure, and how the `Commands` are structured within `Logic`,
I will now take you through what happens when a `Command` is called. +
For instance, `CreateCommand`: +

We will see the case where the input: "create bank1" is valid.

1. It gets parsed by the ParserManager. Depending on the input, a specific `Command` is returned.
In this case, a `CreateCommand` object is instantiated.
2. Depending on the type of Command object, execute() performs slightly different tasks.
In this case, the execute method of `CreateCommand` checks in `Model` to see if the `WordBank` currently already exist.
3. Relevant information is stored in `CreateCommandResult` and is returned back to `LogicManager`.
4. With the retrieved information and type of `CommandResult`, commandResult updates the storage through it's method.
5. The `Storage` abstracts away details and contains well-written methods, each to handle different cases of `CommandResult`.
In this case, createWordBank is called.
6. `JsonWordBankListStorage` contains the abstracted details of how a commandResult should be handled.
For a `CreateCommandResult`, addWordBank and saveWordBank is called.
7. In addWordBank method, it simply adds to the only WordBankList in the entire app. This `WordBankList` is the
same instance as referenced by `Model`.
8. In saveWordBank method, an even lower level saveJsonFile function is called to write to the disk.
This is performed through the common class: `JsonUtil`.
9. In addWordBank method, it simply adds to the only WordBankList in the entire app. This `WordBankList` is the
same instance as referenced by `Model`.
10. It returns void all the way back to `LogicManager`, and then success message is then passed back to `AppManager`,
then to the `UI` to notify the user.

==== Drag and drop feature and it's implementation.
As much as a pro CLI user would love to type all the commands, I figured a good old drag and drop feature will save
the user lots of time. +
It aims to streamline the process of sharing word banks with friends.

From `HOME` mode, you can view `WordBank`, then simply drag and drop a `WordBank`, out of the application, into say,
your desktop, or chat applications. +
From your computer, simply drag and drop a `WordBank` json file into Dukemon's `HOME` page.

With the well designed `WordBankList` data structure and it's functions, drag and drop feature is simply an import and export
function call, linked by the JavaFX's UI drag detection and drag dropped methods.

==== Design Considerations
// Why one WBL is referenced both in model and in storage.
// Talk about the commands being executed in logic, because requires a reference to model and storage.
// Talk about logic is dealing with storage instead of model dealing with storage.
|===
||**Alternative 1**|**Alternative 2**
|**Aspect 1**: +
Data structure for WordBankList.
| **Although WordBankList and WordBank have very similar structures, I made classes for each of them they
each contain a unique list**: +

_Pros:_ +
User's modification to their word banks and cards requires very different methods. These two data structure
requires different access to the storage as well. +
With two different classes, implementation of the Commands that work on these data becomes more distinct.
This ensures methods within `WordBankList` are written for `WordBankCommands` and methods within `WordBank` are
written for `CardCommands`, thereby increasing cohesion of individual components and decreasing coupling between the
two classes.

_Cons:_ +
Implementation requires much more effort.

|**Create a generic data structure class, and let both WordBankList and WordBank extend it.** +

_Pros:_ +
Code that are reusable in WordBank can now be reused for WordBankList.

_Cons:_ +
This couples WordBank with WordBankList. Does not follow the Open-Closed principle.

3+|**Why did we choose Alternative 1:** +
Following the spirit of software engineering principles, it is better to have the basic data structure implemented well.
Commands that depend on it becomes much easier to implement. (This can be seen in the drag and drop feature.)

|===

|===
||**Alternative 1**|**Alternative 2**
|**Aspect 2**: +
Storage system for Word Banks.
| **One single large json file with word bank names as keys and it's word bank data as values**: +

_Pros:_ +
Always save a snapshot of the data to the same file, regardless of what commands are executed.

_Cons:_ +
Unable to share word banks with friends, because one file contains all the word banks.

|**In the default data folder, each word bank is stored as a json file.** +

_Pros:_ +
Enables sharing of word bank files to friends.

_Cons:_ +
Require more consideration to deal with different type of commands which affects the storage dynamically.
Harder to read from multiple files.

3+|**Why did we choose Alternative 2:** +
This choice was based largely from the user's perspective. +
As our app is designed to streamline learning, I figured that easy sharing of word banks file with friends is an important
aspect in our app, and cannot be compromised.
|===


|===
||**Alternative 1**|**Alternative 2**
|**Aspect 3**: +
Command implementation. +
(Same goes for Command Result implementation)
| **All types of commands extends a single abstract class `Command`**: +


_Pros:_ +
A rather simple implementation which does not break any software engineering principles.

_Cons:_ +
Can be further improved, as in Alternative 2.

|**Distinguishing `WordBankCommand` and `CardCommand` specifically - +
Commands that work on Cards extends the abstract
`CardCommand` class and commands that work on `WordBank` extends the abstract `WordBankCommand` class.** +

_Pros:_ +
As I have created distinct data structure for `WordBankList` and `WordBank`, distinguished commands now
work solely on their respective data structure. It follows the Single Responsibility Principle
and the Separation of Concerns Principle more closely, and decreases the coupling between the two component.

_Cons:_ +
Requires tedious implementation to follow the principles.

3+|**Why did we choose Alternative 2:** +
Alternative 2 allows for easy extension of the app's functionality. Implementation of the drag and
drop feature is just a function call away, as all data structure and functions are well written.

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging. The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
