== Introduction - What is Dukemon?

.Home screen of Dukemon.
image::Ui.png[width="790"]

*_Welcome to Dukemon_* _, the Flashcard app of the future!_

_Dukemon_ aims to streamline and gamify the process of learning words or definitions through
the use of self-created digital flashcards. *Supercharge your learning with Dukemon!*

== Getting Started

=== Installation

1.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your system.
2.  Download the latest `Dukemon.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
3.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home directory of _Dukemon_ (this is where your
data will be stored).
4.  Double-click the `Dukemon.jar` to run the app.
5.  Before getting to the quick start instructions, get familiar with our interface and appication modes.

=== User Interface

.Regions of the UI where commands are entered (via CLI) and feedback from Dukemon is shown.
image::UserGuideCommandBox.png[width="790"]

1. Click on the _CommandBox_ as shown above (region in yellow box) and type commands in.

2. Use kbd:[Enter] to execute commands.
.. e.g. Typing *`help`* into the _CommandBox_ and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the _Help_ window.

In the highlighted section above, you can see the current mode you are in and the available modes.



To transition between them you have to enter the `SwitchCommand` that represents each mode into the Command Box that says _Enter command here.._.

* `open` kbd:[Enter] +
to enter `open` mode
* `start` kbd:[Enter] +
to enter `game` mode
* `settings` kbd:[Enter] +
to enter `settings` mode

Yes, it feels like a steep learning curve >_<

But do not worry as we have the AutoComplete Bar that auto completes the available commands whichever mode you are in.

=== AutoComplete Bar

.AutoComplete Bar
image::AutoCompleteBar.png[width="790"]

The highlighted section shows, what commands are currently available. You can click them to automatically fill it in for you. Each of your keystroke will dynamically update the AutoComplete bar, just like the keyboard on your smartphone.

// tag::chenhui-userRevisionBank[]

=== Revision bank

A revision bank is automatically updated for you, every time a game session ends. +
It collates all your wrong cards, whichever _WordBank_ it may have came from. +
It is also smart enough to remove the cards if you have cleared it afterwards.

//.Revision bank alongside with other word banks.

//{nbsp} {nbsp} select revision -> {nbsp} {nbsp}
.Quick look at revision word bank's page.

Revision bank is best appreciated when you actually play around with some word banks, and then visit the revision bank
to revise wrong cards. Give it a try!
