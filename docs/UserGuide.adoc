== Introduction - What is Dukemon?

.Home screen of Dukemon.
image::Ui.png[width="790"]

*_Welcome to Dukemon_* _, the Flashcard app of the future!_

_Dukemon_ aims to streamline and gamify the process of learning words or definitions through
the use of self-created digital flashcards. *Supercharge your learning with Dukemon!*

== Getting Started

=== Installation

1.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed on your system.
2.  Download the latest `Dukemon.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
3.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home directory of _Dukemon_ (this is where your
data will be stored).
4.  Double-click the `Dukemon.jar` to run the app.
5.  Before getting to the quick start instructions, get familiar with our interface and appication modes.

=== User Interface

.Regions of the UI where commands are entered (via CLI) and feedback from Dukemon is shown.
image::UserGuideCommandBox.png[width="790"]

1. Click on the _CommandBox_ as shown above (region in yellow box) and type commands in.

2. Use kbd:[Enter] to execute commands.
.. e.g. Typing *`help`* into the _CommandBox_ and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the _Help_ window.

3. Text-based feedback for each command entered is shown in the _ResultDisplay_ (region in red box).

// end::yida-intro[]

// tag::switchingmodes[]
=== Switching Modes

There are 4 application modes.

.Application modes
image::UGModes.png[width="790"]

.Mode Display
image::RestrictedHomeMode.png[width="790"]

In the highlighed section above, you can see the current mode you are in and the available modes.



To transition between them you have to enter the `SwitchCommand` that represents each mode into the Command Box that says _Enter command here.._.

* `open` kbd:[Enter] +
to enter `open` mode
* `start` kbd:[Enter] +
to enter `game` mode
* `settings` kbd:[Enter] +
to enter `settings` mode
* `home` kbd:[Enter] +
to enter `home` mode

====
*Requirements before changing mode*

* A bank should be selected
* No game should be running

.If other modes are available, they would be displayed beside the Command Box
image::ModesAvailable.png[width="300"]

====

Yes, it feels like a steep learning curve >_<

But do not worry as we have the AutoComplete Bar that auto completes the available commands whichever mode you are in.

=== AutoComplete Bar

.AutoComplete Bar
image::AutoCompleteBar.png[width="790"]

The highlighted section shows, what commands are currently available. You can click them to automatically fill it in for you. Each of your keystroke will dynamically update the AutoComplete bar, just like the keyboard on your smartphone.

=== Drag and drop

Streamline the process of sharing of word banks with friends.

.Word bank file

.Dragging into Dukemon
image::DragAndDrop2.png[150, 150]

.Dukemon registers the bank
image::DragAndDrop3.png[150, 150]

From `HOME` mode, you can view your _WordBanks_. +
Simply drag and drop a _WordBank_ json file from your computer into Dukemon. +
Likewise, drag and drop a _WordBank_ out of the application, into say,
your desktop, or chat applications. +

Try it!

NOTE: Dukemon only reads json files.

=== Revision bank

A revision bank is automatically updated for you, every time a game session ends. +
It collates all your wrong cards, whichever _WordBank_ it may have came from. +
It is also smart enough to remove the cards if you have cleared it afterwards.

.Revision bank alongside with other word banks
image::revisionbank.png[220, 220]

.Screenshot of how a revision page looks like
image::revisionpage.png[700,700]

To try it, simply play some _WordBank_ and then visit the revision bank to attempt all your wrong cards.

=== QuickStart

Lets select the sample _WordBank_ and play a game to get familiar.


1.  `select sample` kbd:[Enter]
* This would allow you to switch modes
2.  `open` kbd:[Enter]
3.  `start` kbd:[Enter]
4.  `guess <your_guess>` kbd:[Enter]
*   keep guessing till the statistics screen appears
* you can switch modes now
5.  `home` kbd:[Enter]

Getting comfortable? Ready to master the application commands?
