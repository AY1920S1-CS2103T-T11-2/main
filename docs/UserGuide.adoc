== Introduction

Our project is a game that requires the user to match a keyword to a given description. This game aims to aid students who are trying to revise concepts and definitions in their schoolwork.

The general flow of the program is as follows:

1. Select and Edit Dataset
2. Configure Settings
3. Start and Play Game
4. End Game
5. Display Statistics

The user manually stores definitions / vocabulary into a word dataset. He can also pre-load a word dataset given to him from a file. During the game, you will be tasked to type the correct word given the description. Depending on the game mode, there may also be time restrictions. Answer correctly as quickly as possible and to score as much as you can! You can view your statistics afterwards to review your performance!

== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
.  Download the latest `dukemon.jar` link:{repoURL}/releases[here].
.  Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the home folder for your Address Book.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.

+
.  Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`/help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* *`/list`* : lists all data sets.
* **`/start`** : starts the quiz.
* **`/stop`** : stops the quiz
* *`/exit`* : exits the app

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

====
*Command Format*

* All commands are typed with `/` in front of them to differentiate them from answers that the user puts in. `~` will be used as an escape character in case `/` is used as part of the answer.
    - Eg, `~/help` will be intepreted by the computer as a string "/help" instead of the command `/help`.
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as `{nbsp}` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be in any order e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
