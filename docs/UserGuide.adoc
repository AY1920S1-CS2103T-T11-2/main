== Introduction - What is Dukemon?

.Home screen of Dukemon.
image::Ui.png[width="790"]

*_Welcome to Dukemon_* _, the Flashcard app of the future!_

_Dukemon_ aims to streamline and gamify the process of learning words or definitions through
the use of self-created digital flashcards. *Supercharge your learning with Dukemon!*

.General program flow of Dukemon, showing how the different parts work together.
image::UserGuideFlowOverview.png[width="790"]

The general flow of the *_Dukemon_* is as follows:

1. Create/Choose a _Wordbank_.
2. Create/Add/Modify _Cards_ of your _WordBank_. (Each _Card_ contains a _Word_ and _Meaning_).
3. Configure your preferred _Settings_. (change _Difficulty_, _Theme_ etc.)
4. Start the _Game_!
5. Guess  _Words_ based on each _Meaning_ that appear- as quickly as possible!
6. Finish the _Game_ and  view the _Statistics_ for your game session.
7. Evaluate your performance, and revisit _WordBanks_ to beat your  high score.

Create and design your own _WordBanks_ and _Cards_ to practice and test yourself! You can also import _WordBanks_ directly,
enable _Hints_ and do other cool stuff, which are explained in the following sections. +
